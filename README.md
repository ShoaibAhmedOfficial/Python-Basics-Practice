# Python-Basics-Practice
This repository contains my initial Python practice files, created during the early phase of my learning journey. The purpose of these files was to build a strong foundation by practicing basic Python concepts and syntax.

**Dates:**	A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named datetime to work with dates as date objects.

**Dictionary:**	Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
**Operators:**	Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
**Membership_Operators:**	Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object
**Module:**	Consider a module to be the same as a code library. A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
**Nested Dictionaries:**	A dictionary can contain dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries.
**Sets:**	Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
**Strings:**	Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
**Tuples:**	Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable
**For Loop:**	A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
**While Loop:**	With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
**Lists:**	Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
